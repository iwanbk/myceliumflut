## Development

### prequisites

- install Android Studio
- install flutter SDK


### dependencies

Put `mycelium` code into the same parent directory as this `myceliumflut`.
Something like this
```bash
dev_directory/
    mycelium/
    myceliumflut/
```
It is because we currently put `mycelium` dependency as local files (not github project) to ease the development.

Checkout to `tun_android` branch of `mycelium` 

### run
- `code .`
- open `lib/main.dart`
- modify this line `'nodeAddr': '5b4:86cf:d8db:87ee:3c:ab49:ef82:8f81'`
- `Run` -> `Start Debugging`
